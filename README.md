NSDog
=====

 Still using NSLog?

 Why log something at a single point in time when you can make a **Dog** that will dynamically log object properties in real time! 

 Dogs use KVO Observation to track objects **throughout their lifetime** 

- Attach a Dog to any object and it will **bark** (a log message) when that object is deallocated.
- A Dog can watch any property of an object and **bark** (a log message) when it changes.

- #####NSDog is your best friend when it comes to debugging Objective C!

 - And it's as dead simple as this:

 `NSDog(myObject, @"frame");`
